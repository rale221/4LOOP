Ultimate Tic Tac Toe!
The board game is composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger board. The game starts with X playing in any of the 81 empty spots. This move sends their opponent to its relative location. For example , if X played in the top right square of their small board, then O needs to play next in the small board at the top right of the larger board. To win the game, you have to win three of the larger squares in the row.
